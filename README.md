# FIT5120: Industry Experience Project

FIT5120 Iteration Project Name: EmpowerWomen

## Problem Statement

Many Australian mothers stop their careers and drop out of the workforce after giving birth, with more than 54% staying at home for 18 months before returning to work. Mothers who want to return to the workforce often worry and struggle due to their lack of job skills, work experience, and work-life balance issues, but only 32% of mothers who return to work have confidence to do so. It is vital to provide mothers returning to work with the right job skills and career options that fit their lives. How can we help Australian mothers returning to work build workplace confidence and work-life balance?
