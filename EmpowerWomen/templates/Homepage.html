        In Australia, the Labour force participation rate for women (62.2%) is significantly lower than for men (71.0%),
        and women are the primary carer in 52% of households. In addition, more than 41% of women returning to work
        received a lower rating from their employer and 85 % felt they struggled to balance work and life commitments.
